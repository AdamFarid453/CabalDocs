## Cabal

> A safe way to exchange sensitive KYC data

## What it is

Cabal gives power to Users by allowing them to be in control of the data they share. As a developer you can utilize our Cabal SDK in order to create a log in service, encrypted data exchange, or data marketplace.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- OAuth built for Web3
- Cabal Developer SDK
- Standardized authentication flow for Web2 & Web3

## Why Cabal is a good idea?

Cabal allows for a way to bring trust into data exchanges between Users and any company requesting data. Users will have the ability to revoke access to a company obtaining its data at a given notice.

## Examples
